## Lab 32-combining-reducers

This project creates an app with React components and routing that incorporates front-end routing.  The app uses Redux state management.  The structure follows:

```
App
  Provider
    BrowserRouter
      Route / Dashboard
        CategoryForm -- for creating categories
        [CategoryItem] -- list of CategoryItems
           CategoryForm  -- for updating categories
           ExpenseForm -- for creating expenses
           [ExpenseItem]  -- list of ExpenseItems
              ExpenseForm -- for updating an expense
```

**App component**
The App component sets up the Provider for the redux store and the Router.

**Dashboard Component**
- displayed on the / route
- uses react-redux's ```connect``` to map state and dispatchable methods to props
- displays a ```CategoryForm``` for adding categories to the app state
- displays a ```CategoryItem``` for each category in the app state

**CategoryForm Component**
- expects an ```onComplete``` prop to be a function
  - the function is invoked with the CategoryForm state when the form is submitted
- expects a ```buttonText``` prop to configure the submit buttons text
- supports an optional ```category``` prop that will initialize the state of the form

**CategoryItem Component**
- displays the category's name and budget
- displays a ```delete``` button
  - ```onClick``` the category should be removed from the application state
- should display a CategoryForm
  - ```onComplete``` the form should update the component in the application state
